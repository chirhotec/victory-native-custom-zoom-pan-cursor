# victory-native-custom-zoom-pan-cursor
Example Timeline Chart with custom Zoom-Pan-Cursor Controls, built on Victory Native

Features:
* Timeline Chart to show event duration (my application is showing animation data)
* Custom container for one finger movement of the playhead (cursor), two finger panning and two finger zooming (x axis only). The three gestures are mutually exclusive, so once you start one, you have to lift all fingers to do a different gesture
* Example of zooming/panning with dynamic data
* "Paging" of y-axis data via external buttons
* Mixed control of playhead cursor-- via timeline interaction, or via external controller (animated value in this demo)
